Do you know how virtual functions are implemented by the compiler?

Do you know how templates are implemented?

Are you familiar with the implementation and pitfalls of malloc, free, and the standard new and delete operators?

Do you know how to override and overload new and delete? How are strings stored in the std::string class?

What are the common implementations and performance characteristics of the popular STL classes and functions?

How do your stack and heap lay out in memory? (And on a related note, how do buffer overflows work?)

What are the benefits and pitfalls of static and shared libraries? (Related: allocation/freeing rules when working with shared libraries? What causes loader locks?)

How do you deal with basic thread safety problems?

Can you use SSE and other extensions like atomic compare-and-swap? How do you go about determining if those extensions are available?

What affects the compiler's ability to inline a function?

How could you write a profiler into your code?

What are memory mapped files and why are they useful?

What is IOCP and why is it useful?

Can you throw and catch exceptions? What about SEH? How is exception handling implemented? (There's so much to be asked here...)

Are you comfortable with RAII?
