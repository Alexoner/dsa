/*
 * How many times will this loop execute? Explain your answer.
 *
 * ANswer:
 * infinite times.
 *
 * If you said 300, you would have been correct if i had been declared as an int. However, since i was declared as an unsigned char, the correct answer is that this code will result in an infinite loop.

Hereâ€™s why:

The expression 2 * half_limit will get promoted to an int (based on C++ conversion rules) and will have a value of 300. However, since i is an unsigned char, it is rerepsented by an 8-bit value which, after reaching 255, will overflow (so it will go back to 0) and the loop will therefore go on forever.

int main()
{

	unsigned char half_limit = 150;

	for (unsigned char i = 0; i < 2 * half_limit; ++i)
	{
		// do something;
	}
}
