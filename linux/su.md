## su
`su` - run a command with substitute user and group ID.

OPTIONS
```text
		-, -l, --login
              Start the shell as a login shell with an environment similar to a real login:

                 o      clears all the environment variables except TERM and variables specified by --whitelist-environment

                 o      initializes the environment variables HOME, SHELL, USER, LOGNAME, and PATH

                 o      changes to the target user's home directory

                 o      sets argv[0] of the shell to '-' in order to make the shell a login shell
		-c, --command=command
			 Pass command to the shell with the -c option.
```
## sudo
sudo, sudoedit â€” execute a command as another user

OPTIONS
     -E, --preserve-env
                 Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to preserve their existing environment variables.  The security policy may return an error if the user does not have permission to preserve the environment.

If you have a lot of environment variables, or you export your proxy settings via export http_proxy="...", when using sudo these variables do not get passed to the root account unless you run sudo with the -E option.

	export http_proxy=:7777
	sudo -E bash -c 'echo $http_proxy'

The recommended way of peserving environment variables is to append them to `env_keep` in `/etc/sudoers`:

	/etc/sudoers
	Defaults env_keep += "ftp_proxy http_proxy https_proxy no_proxy"
