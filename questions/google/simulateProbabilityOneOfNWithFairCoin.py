"""
Given a fair coin, simulate the probability of 1/n, where n is an arbitrary positive integer.

================================================================================
SOLUTION

A fair coin can output binary result. And it's easy to simulate probability of 1 over powers
of 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But the target probability is 1/n, and n is an arbitrary positive integer.
So the first problem is to REPRESENT INTEGER with BINARY system.

BINARY NUMBERS!!!
Any integer can be represented with a binary number.
Treat the result of every flip of the coin as 0 and 1. Then if we toss the coin m times,
there are m bits representing a binary number.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY

p(x = 0 | x < n) = p(x = 0, x < n) / p(x < n) = p(x = 0) / p(x < n) = 1 / n.

Take m = ceil(logâ‚‚n). Repeat process of tossing the coin m times, until the
binary number x represented by m tosses in one process is smaller than n.
Then x = 0 indicates the event that x = 0 given x < n, with a probability of 1/n, happened.
Return true, else return false, meaning the event with 1/n probability didn't happen.
