1. The poison wine challenge
You have 1000 wine bottles, one of which is poisoned. You want to determine which bottle is 
poisoned by feeding the wines to the rats. The poisoned wine takes one hour to work. How many 
rats are necessary to find the poisoned bottle in one hour?

Answer:
1) Binary Search
O(NlogN) time complexity, and O(logN) space complexity

2) Binary number
Find the poison bits in binary number.
O(N) time complexity, O(logN) space complexity.
