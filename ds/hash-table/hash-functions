Universal Hashing,Perfect Hashing,Cuckoo Hashing,Tabulation Hashing,...

Hash function for a class whose object is uniquely identified by a k-tuple of integers,
(a1,a2,...,ak).HashMap in Java has c CRC-style Hash function to map integer to bins.
h(a1,a2,...,ak)= a1 + a2 * p + a3 * p^2 + a4 * p^3+ ... + ak * p^(k-1).
