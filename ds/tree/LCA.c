/*
 * Lowest common ancestor
 *
 * In graph theory and computer science,the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of
 * two nodes v and w in a tree or directed acyclic graph(GAD) is the lowest
 * (i.e. deepest) node that has both v and w as descendants,where define
 * each node to be a descendant of itself.
 *  The LCA of n1 and n2 in T is the shared ancestor of n1 and n2 that is
 * located farthest from the root.It's also known as the least common
 * subsumer.

 * for left and right subtree. The node which has one key present in its
 * left subtree and the other key present in right subtree is the LCA. If
 * both keys lie in left subtree, then left subtree has LCA also, otherwise
 * LCA lies in right subtree.
